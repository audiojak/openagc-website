  tagline:
    "Both are AI email clients. Superhuman Mail is a polished, hosted, subscription product for Gmail and Outlook on every platform; Kaluta is a free, open-source Mac client that keeps your mail local and hands the AI work to the agents you already pay for.",
  intro:
    "Superhuman Mail is the best-known fast email client: split inbox, keyboard shortcuts, follow-up reminders, snippets, read statuses and team features, with Superhuman AI drafting replies, labelling mail and answering questions about your inbox. Since 2025 it also offers a hosted MCP server so Claude, ChatGPT or Cursor can read and send your mail. Kaluta approaches the same goal from the other side: no server of its own, no built-in model, and the agents you already use (Claude Code or Codex) working through a small set of mail tools, with your approval before anything is sent.",

    "Agents you already use: Claude Code or Codex, with your existing login and plan, and a local MCP server rather than a hosted one.",
    "Features Superhuman does not have: tasks from email, a writing guide learned from your sent mail with evidence you can see, routines that run in Claude's cloud, Clean Up, and mailboxes of their own for your agents.",

    us: "if you use Gmail on a Mac, already pay for Claude Code or Codex, and want your mail and the AI's access to it to stay under your control. Be ready to build it from source for now.",
