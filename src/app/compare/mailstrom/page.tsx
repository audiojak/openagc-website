    "Both clear a crowded inbox by the thousand. Mailstrom is a paid web service that does it for any IMAP mailbox; Kaluta does it inside a free, open-source Mac mail client that also reads, writes and runs your AI agents.",
  intro:
    "Mailstrom is a bulk clean-up tool: it connects to your mailbox over IMAP, groups mail by sender, subject, date, size and list, and lets you delete, archive, move, unsubscribe or block in one go, with standing rules to keep the inbox clear. Kaluta's Clean Up window does the same grouping and bulk actions, but it is one part of a full email client. The rest of Kaluta (tasks, agents, a writing guide, routines) has no counterpart in Mailstrom, and Mailstrom's Block, Chill and Expire have no exact counterpart in Kaluta yet.",
