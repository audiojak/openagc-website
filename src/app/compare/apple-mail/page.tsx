  tagline:
    "Both are native Mac mail clients that keep your mail on your machine. Apple Mail is built in, works with any account and has Apple Intelligence; OpenAGC is Gmail-only, open source, and built to put your own AI agents to work.",
  intro:
    "Apple Mail is the client most Mac users already have: free, fast, any account type, and since macOS 26 with categories, priority messages, summaries and Smart Reply from Apple Intelligence, processed on the Mac or in Apple's Private Cloud Compute. OpenAGC is narrower and goes further in one direction. It speaks only Gmail, but it lets Claude Code or Codex work on your mail through approved tools, turns email into tasks, learns how you write from your sent mail, runs routines that sort mail every hour, and can give an agent an address of its own.",
