  intro:
    "Everything Kaluta does happens in your Gmail account. Labels, archive, stars, read state, drafts and the Task label all sync both ways, so what you do on your Mac shows up in the Gmail app on your phone a moment later, and the other way round. Kaluta adds the parts Gmail does not have: your own AI agents working through approved tools, tasks from email, a writing guide learned from your sent mail, routines, Clean Up and mailboxes for your agents. Gmail keeps the parts it does best: being everywhere, search across everything, spam filtering, and Gemini for anyone who wants it.",
