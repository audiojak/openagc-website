      <p>
        Kaluta is an open-source macOS email client. It runs entirely on your
        Mac. This policy explains what data the app accesses, where that data
        goes, and what it is used for.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your email is stored only on your Mac. It never passes through servers
          operated by Kaluta or Actual AI — the project operates none.
        </li>
        <li>Kaluta has no user accounts and collects no telemetry or analytics.</li>
        <li>
          Your mail is shared with an AI agent only when you connect one, and
          only through the tools you allow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data the app accesses</h2>
      <p>
        When you sign in with Google, Kaluta requests the{" "}
        <code>gmail.modify</code> scope, to read, organise and send your mail,
        and the <code>userinfo.email</code> scope, to identify which account is
        signed in. It never requests full mailbox access (
        <code>mail.google.com</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        With that access the app downloads your messages, labels and
        attachments directly from Google to your Mac, and sends the actions you
        take — sending, archiving, labelling, deleting — directly back to Google.
      </p>

      <h2>Where your data is stored</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mail is kept in a local database on your Mac, in the app&apos;s own
          container.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google sign-in tokens are stored in the macOS Keychain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Signing out of an account in Kaluta deletes its sign-in tokens and its local mail database. You
          can also revoke Kaluta&apos;s access at any time at{" "}
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">
            myaccount.google.com/permissions
          </a>
          .
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI agents</h2>
      <p>
        Kaluta can connect to AI agent tools already installed on your Mac,
        such as Claude Code or Codex, using your own login with those providers.
        Kaluta never sees your AI provider credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you ask an agent to work on your mail, the agent can use a limited
        set of mail tools. The content it reads through those tools is sent to
        your AI provider under your agreement with them — Kaluta does not
        control how that provider handles it. Every access is recorded in a
        local log you can review. Sending, forwarding and deleting always require
        your approval in the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to set up a Claude cloud routine, it is created in your own
        Claude account and uses Anthropic&apos;s own Gmail connector, subject to
        Anthropic&apos;s terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Google API Services User Data Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Kaluta&apos;s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs
        adheres to the{" "}
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">
          Google API Services User Data Policy
        </a>
        , including the Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used only
        to provide the email features you use in the app. It is not sold, not
        used for advertising, and not used to train AI models by Kaluta or
        Actual AI.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is responsible</h2>
      <p>
        Kaluta is an independent open-source project sponsored by Actual AI,
        which is the developer named on the signed app and on Google&apos;s
        OAuth consent screen. Because the app has no backend, neither the
        project nor Actual AI holds any of your email or account data.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes and contact</h2>
      <p>
        Changes to this policy are published on this page and in the project&apos;s
        public source history. Questions can be raised on{" "}
        <a href={`${GITHUB_URL}/issues`}>GitHub</a>.
